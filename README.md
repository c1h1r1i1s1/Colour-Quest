## 🌱 Challenge Statement

> **How can we use technology to help children connect and engage with the aesthetic beauty of nature in a playful and creative manner?**

---

## 🐸 Project Summary

**Colour Quest** is an interactive outdoor game designed to help children engage with the natural world through colour exploration and creativity. Housed in a friendly frog-shaped handheld device, the game promotes play, learning, and artistic expression.

### 🎮 Game Modes

#### 1. **Colour Hunt**  
Search for specific colours in nature!  
- Scan real-world objects and receive a score based on how closely the colours match.  
- Includes **two difficulty modes** for different age groups.  
- **Colour-blind accessibility modes** built in.

#### 2. **Colour Palette** *(WiFi required)*  
Capture colours from the environment to build your palette.  
- Once a palette is complete, the frog recommends a **creative scene** to draw using your found colours.  
- Uses the **built-in speaker** for fun audio prompts.  
- Encourages **open-ended creativity**.
